That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
Is too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, yeah man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast
