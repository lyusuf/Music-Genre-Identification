Midnight's creepin' in, we know better
Than leaving here together
And in case you were wondering
You've never looked hotter
So why even bother
Looking at the reasons not to
Maybe we ought to

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
And kiss a little more
Think a little less

When your friends start asking you
Look 'em in the eyes
Tell a white lie
How I dropped you off at home
And I walked you to the door
Nothing more
Tomorrow you can say we're just friends
But baby ‘til then

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

I'll go warm up the truck if you wanna hop in
Give you a minute or two
To say goodbye to your friends
Ain't gotta go home
But we gotta get gone
Cause we've already waited way too long to...

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
And do the only thing we've been thinking ‘bout doing
Since the moment, girl, we met

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more

Kiss a little more
Think a little less
Burning up the night like a cigarette
And get you out of this bar
Out of that dress
And kiss a little more
Kiss a little more
Think a little less

Yeah, think a little less
Yeah, think a little less
