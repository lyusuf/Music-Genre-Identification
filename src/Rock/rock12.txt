Sliced up - shot down
Everybody bows down
Kill em all - let em fall
God'll sort em out
Ripped up - zip it up
Really never gave a fuck
Wrecking ball - fuck em all
Never had a doubt

I'm - never gonna be the one to
I'm - always gonna say what I feel
I'm - always do what I do
Sick of all the bullshit

Why - should I
Always be the one to back away
Why - should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking 
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball 

Take down - ground and pound
That's the resolution
Show face - disgrace
A scar of evolution

Nice boots - cheap suit
You're about to find out
Right here - right now
That's what I'm about

I'm - always gonna be the one
I'm - always gonna say the shit that
I'm - always gonna hold a grudge
Sick of all the bullshit

Why - should I
Always be the one to back away
Why - should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking 
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking 
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball

Why - should I
Always be the one to back away
Why - should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
Why - should I
Always be the one to back away
Why - should I
Have to be the one to not say what's on my mind
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball 
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking
I'm a mother fuckin' wrecking ball
