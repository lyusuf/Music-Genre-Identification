I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, the Bowery
And I was high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough

No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me

No, no, no
The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going, I know, where you're going, I know
It ain't me 

I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and the liberties
Never growing up
I'll take with me the Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me, no, no

It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me 

No, no, no
The Bowery, whiskey neat, where you're going, I know, where you're going, I know
It ain't me
