(I'm back) Hotter than a nigga in hell
(I'm back) I know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
(I'm back) Run, hide and tuck in your tail
(I'm back) Soon as I hit the crowd gone yell

(I'm back) Hotter than a nigga in hell
(I'm back) I know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
(I'm back) Run, hide and tuck in your tail
(I'm back) As soon as I touch it the crowd gone yell
(Well I'm back)

Click-clack the prince is back
Even though I been here I still owe yall that
Nigga been low keep but I'm off the rap
Had to get some new bullets and some even bigger guns
