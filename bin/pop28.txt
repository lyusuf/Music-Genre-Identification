I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

First you gonna say
You ain't runnin' game,
Thinkin' I'm believing every word
Call me beautiful,
So original,
Telling me I'm not like other girls

I was in my zone
Before you came along,
Now I'm thinking maybe you should go
Blah, blah, blah,
I be like "Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

All my ladies, listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl, all you gotta say is...

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

Thank you in advance,
I don't wanna dance (nope)
I don't need your hands all over me
If I want a man,
Then I'mma get a man
But it's never my priority

I was in my zone,
Before you came along,
Don't want you to take this personal
Blah, blah, blah,
I be like "Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

All my ladies, listen up
If that boy ain't giving up
Lick your lips and swing your hips
Girl, all you gotta say is...

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

My name is "No"
My sign is "No"
My number is "No"
You need to let it go
You need to let it go
Need to let it go
"Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No"

I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling
("Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No")

I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling untouchable, untouchable
I'm feeling
("Nah" to the "Ah" to the "No", "No", "No")

All my ladies, listen up
